## Setup

This project uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

Copy the contents of the `body` tag from `index.html` to the file you wish to display the survey in and include the 
script tag for the `mbti.js` file after the script tag for jQuery. The demo uses Bootstrap for styling, if you wish to 
use another framework you will need to provide appropriate styling to the elements.
